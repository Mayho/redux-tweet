## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run production`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder in the root dir.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. This is generally a 33% performance gain.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

Runs the source code through eslint, which can be configured in the top-level .eslintrc file.

### `npm run fix`

Will attempt to fix linting errors automatically.
